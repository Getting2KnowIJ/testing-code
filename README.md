# Getting to Know IntelliJ IDEA
# Example Project to Create and Run Tests

This project will let you experiment with creating and running unit tests in IntelliJ IDEA. It is based upon the code we wrote in [writing-code](https://github.com/Getting2KnowIJ/writing-code) but has been changed to let us start writing tests from the beginning.

The full tutorial for learning IntelliJ IDEA is in the book [Getting to Know IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Know-IntelliJ-IDEA-Professional/dp/B0CRGX26QK/).

To use these samples, open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. If you do not have a project open, choose "Get from VCS" from the Welcome Dialog.
4. If you already have a project open, go to the "Git" or "VCS" menu and select "Clone...".
3. Paste `https://github.com/Getting2KnowIJ/testing-code` into the URL input box, and select a location to clone the project to, and press the "Clone" button.

[This video](https://youtu.be/aBVOAnygcZw) shows a walkthrough of the process using the classic UI.

IntelliJ IDEA will download the code and set up an IntelliJ IDEA project. 

There are repositories with more examples for learning IntelliJ IDEA [here](https://github.com/getting2KnowIJ/).
